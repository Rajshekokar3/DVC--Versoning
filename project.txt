# create a git repo and clone it in repo 
2. Create code.py and add code to it (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. git commit push 
4. dvc initiate
4. NOW WE DO "dvc init"
5. Now do mkdir s3 (create a new S3 direcotry)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myreote s3"   #my remote is s3 folder 
7. now "dvc add data/" # dvc is respondible for versoning 
    Now it will ask to do :("git rm -r --chache "data" and "git commit -m" stop tracking data "")
    Beacuse initially we were tracking data /folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle

8. Again we dp "dvc add data/" (create data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
9. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
10. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
11. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
12. Then git add-commit-push (we're saving V2 of our data at this point)
13. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
14. Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data.

#------- versoning of data completed
